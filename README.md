### About Me
üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I worked part-time as a content producer on the [Thomas&Joe Pod](https://xiaohuoche.podcast.xyz/).

But it's not just talk ‚Äì I use my data analysis chops to really understand what listeners love. By keeping an eye on user data, I'm always tweaking and improving our chats to keep you hooked and coming back for more.
